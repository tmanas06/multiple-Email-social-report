# Multiple Email Social Report
This project is a Flask web application that reads data from multiple CSV files and sends an HTML report via email. We can send emails to n number of gmail accounts ,also we can automate this process through cloud too.This report in my example is for data from Twitter analytics. You can use it as an example or you can directly proceed with your own csv files.
